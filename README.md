## Introduction

This repository provides a simple guide to understanding gRPC, a high-performance, open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework. gRPC enables efficient communication between distributed systems, making it easier to build and deploy client-server applications. It uses Protocol Buffers (protobufs) for message serialization and supports various programming languages.

## What is gRPC?

gRPC is a modern RPC framework that allows you to define and use remote service interfaces, abstracting away the complexity of communication protocols and serialization. It supports multiple programming languages, including Go, Python, Java, and more. gRPC offers four types of communication patterns:
1. Unary RPC (Request-Response)
2. Server Streaming
3. Client Streaming
4. Bidirectional Streaming

## Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)

gRPC uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for message serialization. Protobuf is a language-agnostic binary serialization format that is highly efficient and extensible. It allows you to define your data structures and services in a `.proto` file, which is then compiled to generate code in various programming languages.

## How gRPC Works

gRPC follows a client-server architecture, where the client initiates an RPC call to the server. The communication happens over HTTP/2, providing features like multiplexing and header compression. The client and server communicate using defined service methods and Protobuf messages.

## Getting Started

To start using gRPC, follow these steps:

1. Define your service and messages in a `.proto` file.
2. Generate client and server code using the Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`) and the gRPC plugin.
3. Implement the server logic for your service methods.
4. Create a gRPC client to call server methods.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [gRPC Quick Start Guide](https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/).
